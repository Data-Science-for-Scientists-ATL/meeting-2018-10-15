# meeting

## agenda
- take attendance <-- Sena's job as secretary
- ask people times for 
- promote Hadley Wickham talk
- mention people can take Vicki Hertzberg and Melinda Higgins' Big Data Analytics for Health Care class: http://melindahiggins2000.github.io/web2/teaching/
- say Steve Pittard will join us in Nov to talk about web-scraping / text-analysis with R
- start a list of Emory/Atlanta specific datsets

## Pseudoreplication: ht avoid it in experimental design and analysis -- DesirÃ©e De Leon
- p-value
  + probability of seeing your result under null hypothesis
  + NOT prob null is wrong NOR prob of your result

- can you trust your p-value
  + Assumption: values are independent

- extreme example: sex diffs b/t reaction times to eyepuffs
  + you make 10 measurements but you only have two subjects (because you don't have to recruit more people)
  + so effective sample size n is 2!!!

- determining effective sample size N
  + Intraclass correlation coeff. (ICC)
  + ICC = sigma**2 between group / ( sigma**2 between group + sigma**2 wihtin group)
  + "how much clustering is there within groups"
  + then you plug ICC into **design effect** = 1 + (n -1) * ICC

- determining effective sample size N (Markdown notebook)
  Step 1. group means
  Step 2. calculate deviance from group means -- subtract value from mean, get residual
  Step 3. Calculate deviance b/t group means and grand mean, get that deviance score,
          then get sum of squares
          (aside, repeat 10x for data frame but for calculations just extract the two values)
  Step 4. Divide by n-1 to convert to variance components
  Step 5. Plug into ICC equation, get ICC of nearly 1

- so that's how to calculate by hand, but there's a library ICC
  Step 6. calculate design effect
  Step 7. use them together to determine effective N

Why is pseudoreplication a problem?
- if we tell our model we have a bigger sample size than we effectively do

Simulation detour:
- we set mean and variance at population level, give that info to our model, and see how well
our model gives us back what we told it when sampling from the pop. distributions we simulated
- so imagine two groups of animals, experimental and control
- but we accidentally gave both groups saline instead of giving exptl group a drug 
- --> means are the same
- we can run our simulation of this over and over, e.g. 1000 simulated studies
- track frequency of p-values with a histogram
- under our imaginary scenario, p values of <0.05 should only happen about 5% of the time

- but ... what happens with pseudoreplication
  + increased rate of false positives
